# Introduction

This document contains tables and maps pertaining to villages, clusters, and spraying status of Mopeia households. Note: this is preliminary. It uses algorithmic cleaning to remove households which were likely misclassified into the wrong village, and has not been manually checked for accuracy.

## Master static map (all villages in one map)

The below map shows each household (point) with each village's boundary (polygon). Colors are random, but each village gets only one color. This map was produced after removing suspicious/incorrectly coded houses (ie, those that were far from their supposed village.)

```{r}
plot(mop_ll)
cols <- rainbow(nrow(village_df))
for (i in 1:nrow(village_df)){
  
    this_village_number <- village_df$village_number[i]
   # Get the points only
  sub_census <- census_spatial_ll[which(census_spatial_ll$village_number == this_village_number),]
  # Get the border
  border <- gConvexHull(sub_census)
  
  the_data <- sub_census
  the_border <- border
  
  plot(the_border, add = TRUE,
       col = adjustcolor(cols[i], alpha.f = 0.2),
       border =  adjustcolor(cols[i], alpha.f = 0.3))
  points(the_data, pch = '.',
         col = adjustcolor(cols[i], alpha.f = 0.6))
}
```

## Interactive maps (one per village)

The below maps show each village. Households suspected to be misclassified into the wrong village have been removed. Because this removal was done algorithmically (and relatively quickly), it has not been fine-tuned (hence, the presence of some houses which are very far from the others in the village). These are preliminary maps, and should be understood as such.


```{r}
village_df$row_number <- 1:nrow(village_df)
maps <- lapply(village_df$row_number, function(x){
  leaflet_village(x)
})

htmltools::tagList(maps)
# for(i in 1:3){
# # for(i in 1:nrow(village_df)){
#   this_village_number <- village_df$village_number[i]
#    # Get the points only
#   sub_census <- census_spatial_ll[which(census_spatial_ll$village_number == this_village_number),]
#   # Get the border
#   border <- gConvexHull(sub_census)
# 
#   leaflet_village(the_data = sub_census,
#                   the_border = border) 
#   
#   #   # Plot Mopeia
#   # plot(mop_ll)
#   # # Plot the border
#   # plot(border, add = TRUE, col = adjustcolor(color, alpha.f = 0.3),
#   #      border = adjustcolor(color, alpha.f = 0.8))
#   # # Add the points
#   # points(sub_census,
#   #        pch = '.',
#   #        col = adjustcolor(color, alpha.f = 0.6))
#   # # Add title
